## Features

### Self-Custodial

- 🤲 User-centric approach - the keys belong to the user and are securely stored on their device, encrypted and inaccessible to anyone else.
- 🗝 Compatible with hardware wallets like [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) for an extra layer of security.

### Security First

- 🛡 Utilizes battle-proof techniques for encrypting and storing sensitive data, which are commonly used in password managers, to protect user data.

### Dapp Integration

- 🌐 Seamlessly connects with decentralized applications (dApps) across various EVM networks.
- 💼 Supports all the latest Web3 standards.

### Full-Page Dashboard

### Multi-Network Support

- 🔗 Designed to be multi-network, allowing to switch between networks effortlessly.
- 🌐 Easily manage assets and explore the diverse opportunities offered by different networks.

### Open Source

- 📖 Committed to transparency and community-driven development. The project is open source, allowing developers to review and contribute to the codebase.

### User-Friendly Interface

- 🖥️ The user interface is intuitive and user-friendly, making it easy for both newcomers and experienced users to navigate and utilize the wallet's features.

### Offline-first
